# Multi-Port Doom Launcher

## This is a simple launcher for Doom which can be configured for many source ports and IWADs. Users can save common configurations for use later, instead of manually entering their settings for every session.  

## Common parameters such as -fast or -respawn are implemented in a checklist, so they do not need to be manually entered in the arguments list each time. Additionally, a -merge option is present in the PWADs list for users of Chocolate Doom and its forks.  


## Demos can be played back or recorded from the launcher. When recording a demo, the name is entered without the .lmp extension. When recording many attempts, the launcher will detect when a demo with the provided name already exists and increment the output file name automatically (i.e. av20-uvmax.lmp, av20-uvmax2.lmp, av20-uvmax3.lmp, etc...).
